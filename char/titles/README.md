This is a collection of 40K titles from Arxiv collected by Daniel
Maturana. You can use this to come up with new and exciting ideas for
your research so long as you acknowledge Babette Maturana-Thomas in your
acknowledgments. 

To paraphrase 1984: 

    ``If you want a picture of Arxiv, imagine a network 
    shouting `convolutional neural networks' - forever.''
